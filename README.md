# Data Encoder Crypter Encoded AES Hidden Startup

## Overview
Welcome to the **Data Encoder Crypter Encoded AES Hidden Startup** repository. This crypter offers seamless compatibility with both Usermode and Kernelmode, regardless of compiler optimization settings. It has been specifically validated with msvsc++19. If you are looking for a tool to bypass antivirus, crypt payloads, obfuscate code, or create FUD (Fully Undetectable) backdoors, this is the right place for you.

## Features
- **Bypass Antivirus:** This crypter is designed to bypass antivirus software effectively.
- **Crypter Defeats Windows Defender:** Encode your data to bypass Windows Defender.
- **FUD (Fully Undetectable):** Make your payloads fully undetectable with this tool.
- **Obfuscation:** Obfuscate your code to make it harder to understand and reverse-engineer.
- **Payload Encryption:** Encrypt your payloads using AES for secure transmission.
- **Windows Compatibility:** This tool is compatible with the Windows operating system.
